NVIDIA-PERSISTENCED SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
______________________________________________________________________________

This document outlines the source code and build instructions for the NVIDIA
Persistence Daemon, nvidia-persistenced. Information on how to use 
nvidia-persistenced is available in the driver README and via the manpage that
is installed along with the driver or installed from this source package.

The daemon is controlled by an RPC interface that is generated by rpcgen. The
files have been pre-generated for this source package to remove any dependency
on rpcgen on the target system. The build otherwise only relies on the command
line utility m4 to generate the manpage documentation, aside from the standard
build tools.

To build nvidia-persistenced and its manpage, you can simply run:

    make

This will generate all output files within a system-specific subdirectory of
the '_out' directory.

To install nvidia-persistenced and its manpage, you can simply run:

    make install

There are also a few init files included in the source distribution that may
be used to start the NVIDIA Persistence Daemon on system startup. These files
are provided as examples and may not install correctly out of the box. Please
see init/README for more information.
